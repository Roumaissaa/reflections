What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working
   directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new
   repository.
   We initialize a repository so it t can be used to convert an existing,
   unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

   -The staging area: stores information about what will go into the next commit.
   -The working directory: is a single checkout of one version of the project.
   -The Git directory: is where Git stores the metadata and object database for
   the project. 
   Staging area:
   -helps in reviewing changes
