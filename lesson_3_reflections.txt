When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When collaborating with others or to share my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Pull performs a merge when it retrieves changes, so if Git did it automatically I 
   might get a merge conflict.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   Clone: copy a repository into a new directory.
   I use it when I want to work locally.

   Fork: copy a repository in Github.
   I use it when I want to change github repository that I don't
   have permission to change it.

   Branch:
   branch out from the original code base in the same repository
   I use it when I want to add new changes without messing my base code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    If I know that I will not have Internet access for a period of time.
