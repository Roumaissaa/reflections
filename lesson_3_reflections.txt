When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   When collaborating with others or to share my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Pull performs a merge when it retrieves changes, so if Git did it automatically I 
   might get a merge conflict.
